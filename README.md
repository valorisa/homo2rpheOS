Homo²rpheOS (or Homo2rpheOS, pronounced Homomorph[e]OS)

## **Homo²rpheOS - Homomorphic Encryption Framework**

**Homo²rpheOS** is a state-of-the-art open-source framework designed to facilitate the development, testing, and implementation of homomorphic encryption schemes. The project integrates the latest advancements in privacy-preserving technologies, providing a powerful toolkit for developers and researchers in the field of cryptography and secure computing.

### **Key Features:**
- **Homomorphic Encryption Support:** Implements various encryption schemes such as BFV, BGV, and CKKS, enabling computations on encrypted data without decryption.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Compatible with different operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows, ensuring wide accessibility.
- **Easy Integration:** Provides an intuitive API for seamless integration into custom applications, supporting secure data processing for sensitive information.
- **Optimized for Performance:** Includes efficient algorithms for encryption, decryption, and homomorphic operations, tailored to handle large-scale computations securely.
- **Customizable and Extensible:** Built with modularity in mind, allowing easy extensions of existing schemes and addition of new encryption algorithms.

### **Supported Homomorphic Encryption Schemes:**
- **BFV (Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren):** A leveled encryption scheme optimized for integer operations.
- **BGV (Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan):** A more advanced encryption scheme providing support for both leveled and fully homomorphic encryption.
- **CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song):** A scalable encryption scheme designed for approximate computation on real-valued data.
