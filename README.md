### **Homo¬≤rpheOS: Homomorphic Cryptography Framework for Real-World Applications**

Homo¬≤rpheOS (or Homo2rpheOS, pronounced Homomorph[e]OS)

**Homo¬≤rpheOS** is a state-of-the-art open-source framework designed to facilitate the development, testing, and implementation of homomorphic encryption schemes. The project integrates the latest advancements in privacy-preserving technologies, providing a powerful toolkit for developers and researchers in the field of cryptography and secure computing.

Homo¬≤rpheOS is an open-source framework leveraging cutting-edge **homomorphic encryption (HE)** techniques, designed to enable secure computation on encrypted data without decryption. By supporting Microsoft SEAL and providing tools for experimentation, development, and integration, Homo¬≤rpheOS paves the way for privacy-preserving solutions across industries.

#### üöÄ **Key Features**
- **Native Homomorphic Encryption**: Built on the robust Microsoft SEAL library, supporting BFV, BGV, and CKKS encryption schemes.
- **Modular Framework**: Easily integrate custom HE computations into existing workflows.
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Explore practical implementations, from simple polynomial operations to advanced performance benchmarks.
- **Optimized for Alpine Linux**: Lightweight and efficient, ideal for containerized environments or resource-constrained systems.

#### üåü **Why Use Homo¬≤rpheOS?**
In today's world, data security and privacy are paramount. Homo¬≤rpheOS ensures sensitive information remains encrypted, even during computation, mitigating risks of data exposure in sectors like:

1. **Finance**  
   - *Example*: Securely compute aggregated loan risk across multiple financial institutions without exposing individual client data.  
   - *Use case*: Encrypted salary data analysis for employee pay equity studies, while maintaining strict confidentiality.  

2. **Healthcare**  
   - *Example*: Run predictive models on encrypted medical records to identify at-risk patients, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.  
   - *Use case*: Conduct encrypted genomic data analysis for personalized medicine, preserving patient anonymity.

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Installation and Setup**  
To set up **Homo¬≤rpheOS** on Alpine Linux, follow these steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/valorisa/homo2rpheOS.git
cd homo2rpheOS

# Install dependencies on Alpine Linux
sudo apk update
sudo apk upgrade
sudo apk add cmake build-base git libressl-dev python3 python3-dev py3-pip

# Build the Microsoft SEAL library
cd SEAL
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build

# Test SEAL examples
cd native/examples
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target sealexamples
./bin/sealexamples
```

#### üìö **How It Works**  

1. **Encryption of Sensitive Data**  
   - Input data is encrypted using chosen schemes (BFV, BGV, or CKKS).
   - The framework uses polynomial operations (e.g., multiplication, addition) to compute on ciphertexts.  

2. **Secure Computations**  
   - Homomorphic operations allow secure calculations without decrypting data.
   - The noise budget is actively managed to ensure accuracy and security.

3. **Real-World Examples**  
   - Example scripts demonstrate polynomial evaluation, secure addition, and real-world applications like risk scoring in finance or medical data aggregation.
